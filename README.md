Name of Project: Project One First Iteration
Name of File Adders: Rees Bomgarnder & Devlin Hicks
This project will allow you to enter the name of a Wikipedia Article and the program will give you the most recent changes, usernames, and timestamps for the changes. These are all in reverse chronological order. There is one minor complication in that you will have to run this at least twice as there is an error when you run it once. It will go away on the second and further runs. This will be until you stop it.
