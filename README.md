Name of Project: Project One First Iteration
Name of File Adders: Rees Bomgardner & Devlin Hicks
This project will allow you to enter the name of a Wikipedia Article and the program will give you the most recent changes, usernames, and timestamps for the changes. These are all in reverse chronological order. This will be until you stop it. You will need to include an "_" when entering a name into the program, for example, "Thomas_Jefferson"
could work but "Thomas Jefferson" will not when entering into the program.

One more thing, you will probably run into a "CompileJava" error. At least I did when I ran the file on my computer.
You will just need to run the file a second time, and it should work to fix said issue. Alternatively, one could try refreshing the dependencies and this might fix it.
